Secpol
================
**version 0.1**

Export Secpol.msc GUI to csv 

A simple tool to export out the secpol settings to a csv. built with AHK.. code included
I found no command to get the same output than manually exporting from secpol.msc
still a work in progress 

Tested on Windows 10 - your mileage may vary .. let me know if you have issues 7

i will make a parser at some point 


Usage
---------
**Windows Only** 

drop the exe on the box 

right click - run as admin. 

**Hands off mouse and keyboard until its finished (when secpol.msc closes)** - this will get things out of sync
 
it will create a folder on the desktop with csv files . copy them off and review..

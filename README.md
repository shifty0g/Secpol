Secpol
================
A simple tool to export out the secpol settings to a csv. build with AHK.. code included
I found no command to get the same output than manually exporting from secpol.msc

Usage
---------
drop the exe on the box 

right click - run as admin. 

**Hands off mouse and keyboard until its finished** - this will get things out of sync 

it will create a folder on the desktop with csv files
